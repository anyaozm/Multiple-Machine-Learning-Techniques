# Dependensies 
- [ ] Numpy
- [ ] Matplotlib(IF YOU WANT TO display trends, I put a # on them to help with processing speed)
- [ ] Scikit Learn
- [ ] Keras
- [ ] Tensorflow
- [ ] Math
- [ ] Pandas


## Steps
- [x] Import dependencies
- [x] Load Training Features Data
- [x] Turn data into a pandas data frame and Display
- [x] Replace the strings in thal column with corresponding numbers
- [x] Turn features into numpy arrays  
- [x] Check shape
- [x] Split the model 
- [x] Define the Model
- [x] Fit and train models into sklearn machine learning model of choice 
- [x] Let's Evaluate Our Model with the loss function and accuracy
